# TegMem
Online personal diary/logbook

MySQL interface to generally keep track of things, modelled on a very global human memory structure: semantic memory, episodic memory, and working memory. This structure is nested in different "Brains" for different contexts.

SetupDB.php lets you create a brain.
index.php lets you access existing brains.

In header0.php, adjust the XXX's for your system/preferences.
